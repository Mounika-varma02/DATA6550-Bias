## Individual Analysis: Distance From Home vs Attrition



### Objective
To investigate the correlation between the Monthly Income and employee attrition and determine whether income is a source of economic bias during predictive modeling.

### Methods
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Boxplots and histograms to investigate the distribution of income.
Comparison of attrition percentage in the income groups.
Logistic regression modeling to assess the predictive importance.

### Key Findings

The employees with lower income demonstrated much greater rates of attrition than their higher-income counterparts.
The logistic regression model showed that Monthly Income was statistically significant.
There was a skew to the right of income distribution as it showed hierarchical organization of the organization.
Income seems to serve as a proxy measure of the level of job, tenure and promotion prospects instead of being a direct cause of attrition.

### Ethical Consideration

Predictive systems based on overreliance on income can create bias in the economy.
Structural inequality is commonly manifested in income differentials, rather than performance differences.
The classification of low-income workers as high risk can strengthen the status quo.
