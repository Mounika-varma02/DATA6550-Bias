## Individual Analysis : Overtime and Attrition
This folder contains my individual contribution to DATA6550 Data Bias Project

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to study the relationship between employee overtime and attrition. It aims to identify whether excessive workload leads to higher employee turnover and impacts retention.

## Methods
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Bias detection / evaluation
* Visualizations and insights
* Clear step-by-step notebook workflow

## Key Findings
Employees who work overtime show a significantly higher attrition rate compared to those who do not, indicating that excessive workload is linked to increased turnover. The analysis suggests that poor work–life balance caused by overtime may contribute to employee dissatisfaction and retention challenges.

## Ethical Consideraton
This analysis considers ethical issues related to employee fairness and well-being, particularly how excessive overtime may create unequal workload pressure and contribute to burnout. It is important to use the findings responsibly to support fair workplace policies, protect employee privacy, and promote healthier work–life balance rather than unfairly targeting specific groups.
