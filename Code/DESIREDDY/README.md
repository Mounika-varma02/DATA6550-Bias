## Individual Analysis: Gender and Age vs Attrition
This folder contains my individual contribution to the DATA6550 Data Bias Project.

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to examine whether employee attrition differs across gender and age groups. I wanted to explore whether these demographic factors are associated with different retention patterns within the organization.

## Methods
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created age group categories for comparison
Calculated attrition percentages across gender and age groups
Generated bar chart visualizations to clearly present the results
