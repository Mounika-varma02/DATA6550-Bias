## Individual Analysis: Gender and Age vs Attrition
This folder contains my individual contribution to the DATA6550 Data Bias Project.

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to examine whether employee attrition differs across gender and age groups. I wanted to explore whether these demographic factors are associated with different retention patterns within the organization.

## Methods
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created age group categories for comparison
- Calculated attrition percentages across gender and age groups
- Generated bar chart visualizations to clearly present the results

## Key Findings
The analysis shows that attrition rates are not exactly the same across genders, although the difference is moderate. When employees were grouped by age, some age categories showed relatively higher attrition than others. These patterns suggest that career stage and demographic characteristics may be related to turnover trends

## Ethical Considerations
Gender and age are sensitive demographic attributes. While the analysis does not establish causation, differences in attrition rates should be interpreted carefully. Using demographic patterns directly in predictive models without context could unintentionally reinforce unfair assumptions or bias.
