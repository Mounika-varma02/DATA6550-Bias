## Individual Analysis: Distance From Home vs Attrition

This folder contains my individual contribution to the DATA6550 Data Bias Project.

### Objective
To examine whether commuting distance is associated with employee attrition and explore its potential role as a proxy variable.

### Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms and boxplots
- Attrition percentage comparison across distance groups

### Key Findings
Attrition increases gradually as commuting distance increases. Employees in the "Far" category show the highest attrition rate. Although the relationship is moderate, the pattern suggests commuting burden may influence retention outcomes.

### Ethical Consideration
Distance from home may act as a proxy for socioeconomic status, potentially introducing unintended bias in predictive models.
